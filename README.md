balls

- Mouse keypresses dont work (&mkp LCLK and whatnot)
- Right side doesnt work at all
- Encoder doesn't work
- A bunch of other shit: I assume that there are formatting issues

Notes:
- The physical keys are all fine
- The mouse keypressed worked when I only configured the left side as a non-split keyboard
